# Pizza-Order-System
Global AI Hub Project

The aim of the project is to provide information about both the pizza and the sauce and the order amount by getting the desired pizza type and sauces by the user, while at the same time keeping the information received from the person for payment in a database (that is, a log is created by saving it to a csv file).
